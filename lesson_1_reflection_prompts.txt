How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
	It isolated changes made between the two files and thus reduces the searching area that the fault could be in.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
	It can be usefull to isolate faults created by changes in the file.
	These faults can then be tracked down easially using the correct functions such as "diff".
	It can also be useful to track changes made by different parties.
	It can be useful if you have to fall back to an older version for some odd reason.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit,
like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
	Pros -	You have control over it and thus will be able to keep it logical for you or anybody else to follow
	cons -	You might loos all data up untill previous commit in case something goes wrong/PC crash etc
			You might incorrectly juge your interval required and create a less successful "backup".

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
	When treating files independantly you save space, when using big files this might be a valible point.
	When treating files together you keep everything together and each new file hase its own supporting file, 
	this is easy for tracking changes and usefull to recover code.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
	git log -	displays the historical gits
	git diff -	uses the same princepal as "diff" exept you use git IDs instead of file names

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
	With git it is more flexable. By using it you are able to make changes to previous versions of code without 
	affecting your current code and thus you can experiment without the issue of breaking your current "working"
	code.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
	I am going to try and use it for version control for my future programs that I will be doing.
	THis include android applications that I whant to start develope.
